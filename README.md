## How to use
Launch _ReadRunner Playground_ as a Jupyter notebook (Python 3). Run the first fall to launch the user interface:

1. Type in a link to an article you'd like to read.
2. Type in your desired words per minute.
3. Begin reading faster than you've read before!

_Tip: begin around 100-150 WPM. You'll find yourself increasing speed pretty quickly from there._
